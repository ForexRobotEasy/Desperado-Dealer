## Code Details
The code provided in this file is a simplified version of the Desperado Dealer trading robot. It includes the necessary libraries and defines a list of currency pairs to be traded.

### Libraries Used
The following libraries are included in the code:
- Trade.mqh: Provides functionality for trading operations.
- Expert.mqh: Implements the expert advisor logic.

### Currency Pairs
The code defines an array named `currencyPairs` which contains a list of currency pairs to be traded. The current list includes the following pairs:
- CADJPY
- EURNZD
- GBPCHF

### Main Function: OnStart()
The `OnStart()` function is the entry point of the code. It initializes the trade and expert objects, sets up the price tracking algorithm, adds the currency pairs to the software, and performs forex market analysis.

The code checks if there are any preferred currency pairs based on the market analysis. If preferred currency pairs exist, the code implements a band trend-based expert advisor and starts trading.

The function returns a logical conclusion in the form of an integer value (0 in this case).
